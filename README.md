# Shell_Leetcode_Practice
This is a repository to have a record of all the Shell BASH Leetcode Practices that I have completed in order to improve my understand in bash scripting and shell commands. 

# What is including inside this repository? 
This repository has all of the potential answers on the Shell Leetcode questions that I have worked on. It will include the .sh file. Please note that in order to make a shell file runnable, one will have to do chmod +x [BASH FILE NAME]. This in turn will create a [NAME_OF_THE_FILE].sh* with an asterix symbol that will give you the opportunity to run this file by doing ./[NAME_OF_THE_FILE].sh 

If a specific answer requires any diagram or explanations, those will be created and then scanned as a PDF which will then be stored and added to this repository as well. Every question would be stored in a separate subdirectory and commits will be made consistently to ensure that one can be able to go through the history of the repository to understand what might be logical approach to the question might be. 

Hope you like this repository and don't forget to check out my other repository that deals with questions on Greedy Algorithms, Trees, Sorting, Network Graphs, SQL, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Recursion and so much more! Please feel free to share this repository with more people who might need help in their journey of becoming a Junior Developer.
